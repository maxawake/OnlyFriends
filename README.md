# OnlyFriends

Open Source Social Media App

# Motivation

This is my attempt to save the internet as we have all known and loved it. The past couple of years, all popular social media became the same algorithmic hell, while effectively all beloved niche communities and forums have vanished. Multiple studies provide evidence that modern social media consumption of directly linked to significantly increased depression and suicide rates amongst teenagers. The design of current social media is engineered to keep users on the screen at all costs. I just wish to be able to keep in touch with my friends over the internet. I want to see what they are up to and i want to be part of that community.

OnlyFriends is supposed to provide a very simple platform to build online communities, especially, but not only, with your friends. As long as it will be possible, this platform is going to stay commercial-free and open source and in the best case, fully funded by donations. This way, there is no need to artificially create user-engagement, no algorithms providing you the content based on your preferences, no suppression of content your friends create in favor of suggested material. Only a clean, chronological and custom feed. 

Instead of increasing profit, this social media app should grow dynamically and transparent with its users and their desires. No unnecessary changes.

# Architecture

Initially a react-native expo app, using established design patterns from other social media:
- Feed with posts by friends (endless or pages)
- Profile/Blog featuring own posts
- Posts can be anything (e.g. Images, Text, Videos, Music, GIFs, etc)
- Search bar to find friends
- Events/Calender
- Chat system
